# Indexing is defined as the process of specifically finding out the position of characters individually in a string or another format
# such as tuples, dictionaries, liat, float etc.
# Indexing starts with the number 0 when counting from the left side or the starting point of the content to be checked while counting
# from the right side or the ending point you count from -1. The act of indexing strings is known as "Slicing a string"
