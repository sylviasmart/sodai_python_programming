# Range function accompanies the loop. It is a built-in function that helps to write a loop faster.
# It is represented as range(N), where range is the function and N isthe argument.
# When a range has two arguement in it, one serves a the start and th other as its end order.
# When it contains three argument, the first serves as the start order, the second as the second order...
# ...and the third as the end/stop order.

# In the below, the range instructs that it starts from 0 and ends in the element 5.
range[0,5]


# The below range instructs that it starts at the first index 0 which is represent by the number 10,...
# ..the second instructs that it the first ends at 11, while the second starts from 11 and skips three...
# ..elements and the fourth.
# The last range instructs that the loop stops.
range[10, 11, 15]
